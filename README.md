**Malware Analysis Journey**
Welcome, everyone! We're all on this learning journey together, exploring the fascinating world of malware analysis. Using the book Practical Malware Analysis: The Hands-On Guide to Dissecting Malicious Software by Andrew Honig and Michael Sikorski, we'll dive deep into the subject by solving labs and sharpening our skills.

**Lab Solutions**
You can find all the lab solutions right here in this repository. Feel free to explore, learn, and contribute as we tackle these challenges together.

**Note:** These labs involve real-world malware. To ensure your system's safety, do not run any samples on your main operating system. Always use a secure, isolated environment, such as a virtual machine, for analysis.

Best of luck, and let's make the most of this experience!

**Happy learning!**
